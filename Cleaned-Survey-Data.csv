First, I took the right path and registered with CIBA which is known as SAIBA as Business Accountant In Practice (BAP) until now. From now on I want to expand my business e,g to have my own land and build the firm to be a hand office where i would accommodate trainee accountants since now am working with Sekhukhune Tvet College am one of their stakeholder we host their student for 18 months which are from local. We aim at having permanent and qualified accountants and more branches from different provinces .","I want to emphasize that Janericon Accountants is not just an Accounting firm but is a number one stop accounting firm which specializes in Accounting Services, Graphic Solutions, and Website Development. We also offer software training for small or medium businesses. We have designed packages for clients which those who are under graphics need us to outsource for printing and all our profit goes to the supplier so we can do everything from designing but we need printing machines for final products to be delivered to our clients. We have proof of projects we did for our clients which if we had our own machines the company would have grown and graphics contribute a lot from the business. I would also appreciate it if the Anglo American can put us from their database for opportunities like helping SMME with their compliance even if there is a container so that they can quickly find us when they need help.","1.Accounting Services

The creative hub will assist the community in finding all the information they need regarding their business development and also create a space for them to come togather and work togather to fight unemployment and grow the township economy through Enterprenuership, this space will empower and encourage collaborations and different types of partnerships, trainings and skills development programs. 

Looking at the unemployment rate in South Africa currently,which also includes graduates I think this initiative will come in very useful as a way of educating them that they can still go out there and use what they have studied towards and be their own bosses considering their fields of study, and this will help create employment in our communities.

It aims at addressing the increased unemployment rate caused by the depression of trade sectors, retrenchments and other industry mechanizations. This was and still is being achieved after establishing a 
close corporation with the following as its principal business activities.


POLOKWANE HOLDINGS has also realized the availability in abundance, of core skills and knowledge in this country, which seeks to be targeted into the group’s activities. We also developed some vocational training programs for skill development to semi –skilled and unskilled people. We thus seek to synergies skills until a competitive critical mass is achieved, to formalize these entities in term of planning, administration, and marketing and procurement functions necessary to compete satisfactorily in the open market.


POLOKWANE HOLDINGS is convinced, this philosophy is ideal means of poverty eradication and in long term Limpopo Province will emerge as one of the most competitive economies in Republic of South Africa.

Goal 1: Secure funding to expand farm infrastructure, including greenhouses, irrigation systems, and storage facilities.
This will allow for higher production capacity, better quality control, and operational efficiency, thereby meeting growing market demands and expanding market reach.

Market Diversification:

Goal 2: Expand market channels beyond local markets to regional and potentially international markets.
Diversifying markets is going to reduce dependency on local conditions and allow expansion of revenue opportunities. It requires funding for market research, partnerships with distributors, and potentially meeting export standards.

Technological Integration:

Goal 3: Invest in technology to enhance farm efficiency and productivity.
Technologies such as farm management software, precision agriculture tools, and automated irrigation systems can optimize resource use and reduce costs. Funding will be needed for initial investments and training.

Financial Viability and Profitability:

Goal 4: Achieve financial sustainability and profitability.
Funding will support initial expansion costs and operational improvements, aiming to increase revenue and achieve profitability within the three-year timeframe. Monitoring financial metrics and adjusting strategies accordingly will be crucial.

Community Engagement and Development:

Goal 5: Engage with the local community and contribute to economic development.
Explanation: Community engagement initiatives, such as training programs, job creation, and supporting local suppliers, can enhance social impact and build positive relationships. Funding will be used for community projects and outreach.

Risk Management:

Goal 6: Develop and implement risk management strategies.
Identifying and mitigating risks, such as market volatility, weather-related risks, and operational challenges, will safeguard the farm's operations and financial health.

Over the next three years, we aim to grow our farm by 20% annually. We’ll do this by adding more land and using eco-friendly methods like crop rotation, organic fertilizers, and efficient water systems. Our goal is to increase how much we produce and improve the quality of our crops, all while keeping our impact on the environment low. With responsible growth, we hope to ensure long-term success and help the local ecosystem.
Technological Advancements and Innovation
Modern farming needs technology, so we plan to invest in the latest tools. In the coming years, we’ll use precision farming equipment like GPS-guided machines, drones for checking crops, and sensors that give real-time data. These tools will help us use resources better, keep our crops healthy, and boost productivity. We also want to set up a research unit to find new farming methods and stay ahead in the industry.
Market Expansion and Brand Building
To grow our business, we need a strong market presence and brand. We plan to enter new regional markets and partner with local distributors and retailers. Over the next three years, we’ll work on building our brand through social media, participating in agricultural fairs, and engaging with the community. By building good relationships with our customers and stakeholders, we aim to become a trusted name in farming, known for quality, reliability, and sustainability.
By setting these goals, EBR Farming is committed to a prosperous future that benefits our business, community, and the environment. We are excited about the journey ahead and look forward to achieving these milestones with dedication and innovation.",no,"vegetation , goats , livestock , cabbage , butternut , potatoes ",1,3,5,5,3,5,5,5,5,1,0,1,4,4,2,2,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,Yes,1,4,3,2,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,"Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing"

To achieve success in the initial stages of its business strategy, Flytronix Corporation Ltd must address several key needs that are crucial for establishing a solid foundation and driving growth. These include securing financial support, finalizing core infrastructure, building a strong market presence, and initiating key product and service developments.

 1. Financial Support
